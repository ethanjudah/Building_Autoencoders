# Building_Autoencoders
Building auto-encoders with Keras


Building, training, and evaluating autoencoders using Keras. Here we preprocess data, construct a basic autoencoder architecture, train the model on the MNIST dataset, and visualize the results. Additionally, we explored fine-tuning techniques to enhance the model's performance and applied the autoencoder to denoise images.
